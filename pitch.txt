Laboratory 8: Arrays, Loops and Game Pitch

Part II: Pitch a game idea
It is time to kickstart your final project development, and your first task is to pitch your idea to attract a development team. Thinking of the game development pipeline introduced a few weeks ago, you will be playing the role of the Video Game Producer and the Concept Artist for your project (pre-production phase), trying to make your idea get to the production phase!
Your pitch should include:


1.	Game Idea
			Toby the dog likes going outside so he sneaks out whenever his owner forgets to close the gates. And after too much wandering outside, he gets lost. 
			 So, as a player, help poor Toby return to his owner safely. And to return poor Toby, you need to help him cross the busy roads that is full of rushing vehicles and other potential obstacle that could interfere in Toby’s safe return. 


2.	Character’s actions and goals
			-	Character needs to collect coins and food along the way.
			-	Possibility: avoid other additional characters that can interfere with his goal of getting home.
			-	The character’s goal is to return home safely.  So, the character needs to avoid the cars or other vehicles passing by to cross the roads.

3.	Scenario and characters description (include placeholder graphics, drafts, references)
			-	Busy roads with vehicles that are not stopping.
			-	The dog
			-	Possible obstacle: road construction too with uncovered hole.
			-	Possible bad character: Person who takes dogs and sell them to other people. 
			-	Possible ideas to add also is to add a big bird that Toby should avoid because it could get him. 


4.	Game Win/Lose conditions

			-	The game is a countdown, so the player should not waste time crossing the road.

			-	Win: Player wins if the dog collects coins and returns home before the time runs up.

			-	Lose: Player loses if the time runs out or when the dog gets hit by a car or fell inside an uncovered road hole. 
					  If the time runs out and you have not collected any coins or food, you lose too.


5.	Progression of levels
			-	As the levels increases more roads to cross and more objects/character that could possibly harm the dog or reduce the coins/ food (points) that the already dog have.
			-	Increase speed of vehicles
			-	Add train and train tracks that the dog will need to cross
			-	Bodies of water to avoid also such as lake, etc.
			-	The World design changes to something more complicated than the first level since it more road and challenges needs to be added.

6.	Sources of inspiration (other games, movies, etc that inspired your idea)
			-	Mobile Game: Crossy Road (free on App Store)
			-	News article:  Lost Dog Goes To His Vet To Ask For Help Getting Back Home

			-	Movie: White God 

7.	What skills/interests you are looking for in teammate?
			I am looking for a teammate that knows how to respect his/her teammates. Someone who is open to new ideas and is responsible. 
			It would be great if you also have ideas on how to design the World or an idea just to add something new so that the game will be more exciting.
