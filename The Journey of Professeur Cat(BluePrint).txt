https://github.com/SamPham2020/ProjectTeam10b-.git

Main Platform for team --> Microsoft Teams



At the beginning of the level, Professeur is running home and away from dogs (will be at the beginning of the safe page)
When game starts Professeur makes meow sound
First obstacle is railway trains dont come often but when they do Professeur has to avoid it
Then safe area.
Second obstacle is river where professeur has to climb on pollution that is in the way to cross (cats hate water so you dont want her to fall in)
Then safe area
Last obstacle is roadway roads have lots of traffic and she needs to get across without being run over
Once on other side you go to house and once you touch house you win
Once we reach house we finish the level and you start over in the next level
You win after 3 amount of levels each level the objects will be 3 times faster.

Level one objects will be 1x as fast as level one
Level two objects will be 2x as fast as level one
Level three objects will be 3x as fast as level one
